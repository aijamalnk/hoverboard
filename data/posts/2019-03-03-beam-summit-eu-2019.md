We are super excited to announce the second European Beam Summit, which will take place in _Berlin_, _June 19-20th of 2019_.

**What is the Beam Summit about**?

The Beam summit is a 2 day, multi-track event, where people from the community will have a chance to share all the exciting ways in which they are using, changing, and advancing Apache Beam.
It is a great chance for networking and getting to know local Beam contributors and listen to experts on different topics across multiple tracks.

The agenda will grow and be communicated in the coming month, keep an eye on the page.
